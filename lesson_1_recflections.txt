Using diffs to compare files

using diffs is a great way of finding differences between two different versions of a file
it shows only the lines that changed between versions with the changes made to them
this is much better than comparing files manually.

Having acces to the entire history of a file can make you an efficient programmer.
Maybe a previous version contains something that needs to be present in the newer version
or maybe something in the new version isnt working correctly.
Being able to see into previous versions allows for relatively quick comparisons and
allows for faster decision making and version implementation.

The pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit is that it allows 
the developer to only commit when a set of logical changes are made
making commits easier to distinguish and very useful when checking a 
developments history.  The con is that the possibility exits to forget to commit
and loose the version that has been worked on of the file.

Git is oriented to software development, it is convenient to save multiple files
at the same time when working with such and this is why Git allows this function.
Google docs is oriented towards office productivity in which usually files are 
not necessarilly interelated and can be worked separately.  Tracking files individually
results in a much more convenient application in this case.

Git log and Git diff are very useful commands.  Git logs shows the history of all
made commits on a repository while git diff shows the difference between any
two chosen id's in the log or history.

Being able to snap back in time to previous versions is the real advantage 
behind technology such as git.  It allows a developer to confidently make changes
test out code and if it simply ends up being a mess one can checkout previous working
versions of the code.

Id like to use git effectively in all my projects.  I really need to master git
in order to be a more efficient software engineer.
